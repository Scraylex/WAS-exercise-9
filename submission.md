## Task 1)

Sensing Agent 1 is the most trustworthy using a arithmetic mean trust calculation.

Side Note: Jacomo string equals is non existent weirdly enough??? Works in Java ¯_(ツ)_/¯

## Task 2)

Well the rogues now follow the leader. Wondering if we could do this in some dynamic way. May be a rogue organization I would guess. That could be a pretty interesting idea!
Since we did not change our trust mechanics sensing agent 1 is still the one picked.
